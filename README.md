# BitSequenceGenerator-Assm
A Simple Bit Sequence Generator that can shift bits and generate psuedo random numbers using assembly language and the NIOS II processor on the Altera DE2-115 Board. This project serves to help as an introduction to programming in Assembly Language by using the addresses of registers to store data.
